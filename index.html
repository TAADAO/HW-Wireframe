            Here are the lyrics to the alphabet song!

            <div class="letter-block">
                <h1>A</h1>
            </div> 
            <div class="letter-block">B</h2>
            </div>
            <div class="letter-block">C</h3>
            </div>

            <div class="wirediv">
                D-E-F-G-H-I-J-K-LMNOP-Q-R-S-T-U-V-W-X-Y and Z. Now I know my ABC's. Next time won't you sing with me?
            </div>
        </article>
    </section>
    <aside class="paside">
        This is other stuff related to the alphabet song I guess. Like did you know it's hard to say the alphabet
        backwards when you're 100% sober? So how do cops think you can recite it fluidly if you're drunk?
        It's like they trap you on purpose with that question, as there's really no way out. </aside>
    <footer>
        Finally, the footer to this page. In this case it's just like the header.
